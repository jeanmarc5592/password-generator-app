## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS Library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

Since this was my first own project working with Vue.js it made tons of fun. The past three years working intensively with React helped me a lot to 
grasp the principles of Vue.js fast. 

I also had to row a few steps back to the basics again with writing "clean" SCSS and HTML again. During the past I was heavily used to JSX and 
component libraries like Material UI. So it was really refreshing to wrap my head around this stuff again.

The key learnings of this project were:

- Setup a Vue Project with SASS
- Structure Vue Components
- Styling / Adjusting native html input elements like range and checkboxes
- Collecting Data within Components
- Come up with a good folder / file structure
- Leverage computed properties to apply conditional styling
- Generate a random string in Javascript
- Use watchers to fire logic on specific data property updates

### Continued development

In my next project I'll focus on a state management library like vuex when it will be a bit more complex. Since I'm a huge typescript fan, it will make sense for me to integrate that into my next project as well. I also would like to tackle a project with a higher difficulty / complexity and make it a fullstack application. 

Furthermore I'd like to dive deeper into Vue.js and it's concepts.
